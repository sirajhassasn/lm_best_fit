# lm_best_fit
This r code will give the method for best model fitting. Hereâ€™s an explanation of the R code, broken down step by step:

### Clear Workspace
rm(list=ls())
- Removes all objects from the R environment to start fresh and avoid conflicts with existing variables.
Set Working Directory  
setwd("")
- Sets the working directory to the specified path. This is where R will look for files to read and where it will save output.
Load Data
data <- read.csv("CarPrice_Assignment.csv")
- Reads a CSV file named `CarPrice_Assignment.csv` into a data frame called `data`.
Check Data Dimensions and Preview
dim(data)
head(data)
- dim(data)` returns the number of rows and columns in the data.
- head(data)` displays the first six rows of the data to preview its structure and values.

Select Relevant Columns

mydata <- data.frame(data[, c(26, 2, 10:13, 17, 19:25)])
head(mydata)

- Creates a new data frame `mydata` containing selected columns from `data`. The specified columns are:
  - Column 26
  - Column 2
  - Columns 10 to 13
  - Column 17
  - Columns 19 to 25
- `head(mydata)` displays the first six rows of this new data frame.

Fit Full Linear Regression Model**  
lm(price ~ ., data = mydata)
summary(lm(price ~ ., data = mydata))

- Fits a linear regression model using all columns in `mydata` (except `price`) as predictors for `price`.
- `price ~ .` indicates that `price` is the dependent variable and all other columns in `mydata` are independent variables.
- `summary()` provides detailed information about the model, such as coefficients, p-values, R-squared, etc.

Generate All Possible Models**  
Define Variables and Initialize Formulas:

variables <- colnames(mydata)[2:ncol(mydata)]
formulas <- list()

- `variables` stores the names of all independent variables (all columns in `mydata` except the first column, `price`).
- `formulas` initializes an empty list to store formulas for all possible regression models.

#### Create Formulas for All Combinations of Variables:

for (i in seq_along(variables)) {
  tmp <- combn(variables, i)
  tmp <- apply(tmp, 2, paste, collapse="+")
  tmp <- paste0("price~", tmp)
  formulas[[i]] <- tmp
}

- The `for` loop generates regression formulas for all combinations of variables:
  - `combn(variables, i)` generates all combinations of `i` variables.
  - `apply(tmp, 2, paste, collapse="+")` combines variable names into a single formula string, separated by `+`.
  - `paste0("price~", tmp)` prefixes each formula with `price~` to indicate the dependent variable.
  - `formulas[[i]] <- tmp` stores these formulas in the `formulas` list.

#### Flatten and Convert Formulas:
```R
formulas <- unlist(formulas)
formulas <- sapply(formulas, as.formula)
```
- Converts the nested list of formulas into a flat vector and ensures all formulas are valid R formulas using `as.formula`.

### 8. Fit All Models

models <- lapply(formulas, lm, data = mydata)

- Uses `lapply()` to fit a linear regression model for each formula in `formulas`. All models are stored in the `models` list.

### 9. Count Models

length(models)

- Outputs the total number of models fitted. For 13 variables, there are \( 2^{13} - 1 = 8191 \) possible models.

### 10. Inspect First Model

summary(models[[1]])$r.square

- Retrieves and prints the **R-squared** value of the first fitted model in the `models` list. This indicates how well the model explains the variability in the dependent variable (`price`).

### Summary of What the Code Does:
1. Loads a dataset.
2. Selects specific columns to analyze.
3. Fits a full linear regression model with all predictors.
4. Generates and fits **all possible regression models** (from single-variable models to the full model).
5. Retrieves details (e.g., R-squared) from the fitted models.


### Potential Uses:
This code is useful for exploring variable importance and model selection by evaluating all possible combinations of predictors. It can help identify the best subset of variables for predicting `price`. However, it is computationally intensive, especially for a large number of variables.
